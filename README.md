# quizzical-app

Quizzical is a trivia app. 

Is a solo project from Scrimba [Learn React for free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) course. The Figma base design was changed to allow the user to choose the questions number, category, difficulty and type. Also different styles through the page were applied.
